# Autonomous Search Navigation Robot

In this project, Autonomous navigation of iRobot was implement using RGB camera, Depth sensors and Odometer input.
Sensory information was tranformed to Robot base co-ordinate frame and processed using RTABMap library. 

Simulateneous localization and mapping was performed using RGBD-SLAM algorithm and motion planning / obstacle avoidance was implemented using A-star and RRT algorithms at global and local level respectively.
